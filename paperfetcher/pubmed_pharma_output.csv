40627846,EML4-ALK rearrangement creates a distinctive myeloid cell-dominant immunosuppressive microenvironment in lung cancer.,"Kosuke Arai, Yukari Nishito, Hideaki Mizuno, Noriko Motoi, Nobuyoshi Hiraoka, Masanori Fuse, Yasuhito Arai, Tatsuhiro Shibata, Yukiko Sonobe, Yoko Kayukawa, Toru Maruyama, Hironori Fukuda, Yukihiro Mizoguchi, Yukiko Aikawa, Yukihiro Yoshida, Shun-Ichi Watanabe, Hiromi Sakamoto, Makiko Yamashita, Shigehisa Kitano, Yuki Nagata, Risa Mitsumori, Kouichi Ozaki, Shumpei Niida, Yae Kanai, Akiyoshi Hirayama, Tomoyoshi Soga, Teruhiko Yoshida, Kazuki Yasuda, Atsushi Ochiai, Hiroyuki Tsunoda, Kazunori Aoki","Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Yokohama City, Japan.; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan.; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",Cancer immunology research,2025,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are initially efficacious against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive lung adenocarcinoma (ALK+ LUAD), but acquired resistance inevitably occurs. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are needed for TKI-resistant cases. Although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with ALK+ LUAD exhibit little or no response to immunotherapy and the underlying resistance mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we explored the immunological status of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in ALK+ LUAD tissues. Tumor-infiltrating leukocyte analysis revealed reduced numbers of effector T cells and increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) relative to ALK- LUAD cases, indicating that ALK+ LUAD has a myeloid cell-dominant immunosuppressive TME. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified a subset of macrophages that expressed most T cell-attractant chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and the macrophages were inactivated in ALK+ LUAD. In contrast, ALK+ LUAD expressed high levels of MDSC-attractant chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL8). In addition, ALK+ LUAD showed higher levels of IL-6, an MDSC-inducing cytokine, than ALK- LUAD. An IL-6R inhibitor transformed the TME in a murine ALK+ LUAD model, shifting it from an immunosuppressive to a T cell-dominant status. Although ICI monotherapy lacked antitumor effects, a combination of ICI and the IL-6R inhibitor had significant antitumor effects in mice. Our findings illustrate the molecular basis of fusion gene-mediated immunosuppressive TMEs, providing a rationale for a novel combination immunotherapy for ALK+ LUAD."
40627836,Exploring IDH1 and IDH2 Mutations in Paediatric Medulloblastoma.,"Motaz Fadul, Saleh Baeesa, Alaa Alkhotani, Amany A Fathaddin, Ahmed I Lary, Bassam Addass, Taghreed Alsinani, Ahmed Bamaga, Ahmad Albeshri, Mohammed M Karami, Mohammed A Abutalib, Maher Kurdi","Department of Neurosciences, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Prince Saud Al Faisal Street, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",Folia biologica,2025,"Medulloblastoma (MB) in children is associated with distinct molecular subgroups, reflecting substantial biological heterogeneity. The presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutations in paediatric MB has been rarely reported and not routinely investigated. Our study included 23 samples from paediatric patients diagnosed with MB. Hotspot alterations at codons IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 were examined using Sanger sequencing following polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mean age of the patients was 10 years (SD: 4.25), comprising 17 males and 6 females. All cases exhibited classical histological features of MB. β-Catenin expression was observed in four cases (17.4 %), while 19 cases (82.6 %) showed no expression. No statistically significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) were found between MBs with positive or negative β-catenin expression (P = 0.6). Radiotherapy alone was administered to four patients (17.4 %), while 19 patients (82.6 %) received combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The median PFS was 383 days (1 year and 18 days). IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 hotspot mutations were not detected in any of the samples. The absence of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in paediatric MB may be attributed to differences in mutational profiles and cellular origins in childhood MB, despite its histomolecular similarities with adult MB."

In addition, many older adults have lower health literacy, which impacts their ability to access, understand, and apply health information. Patient education plays a critical role to comprehend a new cancer diagnosis, explore treatment options, and manage care effectively. To be effective, education materials must be specifically tailored to the needs of this population. Despite growing recognition of the importance of geriatric-specific cancer education, no recent review has synthesized the literature on educational interventions or materials developed for this population. This review aims to answer the question: What is known about patient education interventions and materials developed for older adults with cancer and their caregivers and their effectiveness to improve outcomes?. We will follow the Arksey and O'Malley framework, refined by Levac et al., and report according to the PRISMA-ScR checklist. We will search Medline ALL, Embase, Emcare, Cochrane Central, PsycInfo (all via OvidSP), and Scopus (via Elsevier) for studies published from 2000 onward and complete a manual search of the references of included studies. A health sciences librarian conducted the searches. We will include peer-reviewed and relevant grey literature. Stakeholder consultation will be conducted to inform interpretation of findings and identify gaps. Eligible studies will use qualitative or quantitative designs focused on geriatric oncology patient education. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data using Covidence and Excel. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis. The quality of peer-reviewed studies will be appraised with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (2018) for descriptive purposes only. This scoping review will map existing educational interventions and materials for older adults with cancer, support clinicians in practice, and highlight gaps to inform future research and development."

Loss of epigenetic repression can result in the aberrant expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle and can cause facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). Multiple factors have been identified as necessary to maintain epigenetic silencing of DUX4 in skeletal muscle, but whether specific sequences at the DUX4 locus are sufficient for initiating epigenetic silencing has not been known. We cloned fragments of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat, the DNA region that encompasses the DUX4 retrogene, adjacent to a reporter driven by a constitutive promoter and identified a single fragment sufficient to epigenetically repress reporter gene expression. Previously identified repressors of DUX4 expression-SETDB1, ATF7IP, SIN3A/B, and LRIF1-were necessary for silencing activity and p38 inhibitors enhanced suppression. These findings identify a key regulatory sequence for D4Z4 epigenetic repression and establish a model system for mechanistic and discovery studies."

Nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery approaches the therapeutic activity of immune cells only toward tumor cells without inflicting damage to healthy tissues like those sustained by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Neuroblastoma treatment faces two major barriers: penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and using nanoparticle technology. The promising developments for neuroblastoma treatment emerge from mRNA COVID-19 vaccine research and brain cancer vaccine clinical trials especially through phase I autologous dendritic cell vaccine studies. Future research needs to develop optimized nanoparticles which can trigger the release of mRNA or peptides based on tumor-specific pH and enzyme signals. The BBB can be opened temporarily through ultrasound and receptor-mediated transport approaches, which enhance vaccine delivery to brain tissues. New immunotherapeutic approaches for pediatric malignancies emerge from these recent findings to yield future success."

Identifying TMEs that are susceptible to specific therapeutic interventions paves the way for more personalized and effective treatments. In this study, using a spontaneous murine model of breast cancer, we characterize a TME that is responsive to inhibitors of the heme degradation pathway mediated by heme oxygenase (HO), resulting in CD8+ T- and NK-cell-dependent tumor control. A hallmark of this TME is a chronic type-I interferon (IFN) signal that is directly involved in orchestrating the anti-tumor immune response. Importantly, we identify that similar TMEs exist in human breast cancer which are associated with patient prognosis. Leveraging these observations, we demonstrate that combining a STING agonist, which induces type-I IFN responses, with an HO inhibitor produces a synergistic effect leading to superior tumor control. This study highlights HO activity as a potential resistance mechanism for type-I IFN responses in cancer offering a novel avenue for overcoming immune evasion in cancer therapy."

While a high MHC Class I, immune-inflamed subset benefits from ICB, underlying mechanisms of immune response in SCLC have yet to be elucidated. Here we show that in the landmark IMpower133 clinical trial high, but not low, NOTCH1 expression is significantly associated with longer survival with the addition of ICB to chemotherapy among ~80% of SCLC patients with neuroendocrine-enriched tumors (ASCL1-enriched, HR 0.39, P = 0.0012; NEUROD1-enriched, HR 0.44, P = 0.024). Overexpression or pharmacologic activation of NOTCH1 in ASCL1 and NEUROD1 SCLC cell lines dramatically upregulates MHC Class I through epigenetic reactivation of STING. In syngeneic mouse models, Notch1 activation reprograms SCLC tumors from immune-excluded to immune-inflamed, facilitating durable, complete responses with ICB combined with a STING agonist. STING1 expression is significantly enriched in high compared to low NOTCH1 expressing tumors in IMpower133 thereby validating our proposed mechanism. Our data reveal a previously undiscovered role for NOTCH1 as a critical driver of SCLC immunogenicity and a potential predictive biomarker for ICB in SCLC. NOTCH1 activation may be a therapeutic strategy to unleash anti-tumor immune responses in SCLC and other neuroendocrine cancers in which NOTCH1 is typically suppressed."

We report the optimization of conditions and clinical factors that correlate with the successful establishment of primary STS cell lines. We focus on leiomyosarcoma (LMS), myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), which are adult STS with complex genomics and poor survival rates. We initiated cell lines from 165 fresh STS specimens. Cultures were classified as: 1) no/little in vitro growth or 2) persistent growth. Tumor and clinical characteristics were analyzed to determine their correlation with cell line growth. To determine whether cell lines shared tumor-specific variations (TSVs) and mutational signatures with bulk specimens, comparative and COSMIC mutational signature analyses were performed on a subset of cases with cell line, tumor and blood DNAs available. Cell lines were established from 46 specimens (28%). MFS specimens yielded more successful cell lines (p<0.05) than LMS specimens. Primary specimens from treatment-naïve patients and those who presented with metastases demonstrated higher success rates (p<0.05) versus treated specimens and those who only had local disease, respectively. Cell line growth was not associated with patient outcomes or specimen grade. Six of the eight cases retained TSVs, including in ATRX or TP53, while two did not retain TSVs. Paired samples shared clock-like mutational signatures. Xenograft mouse models were created with a subset of the cell lines. The development and characterization of preclinical STS models will advance our understanding of STS biology."

However, current strategies, such as immune checkpoint blockade, primarily restore exhausted T cells but provide only transient efficacy, as the rapid clearance of antibodies. Their limited durability is further hindered by persistent T cell-tumor cell interactions that accelerate T cell exhaustion. To prevent T cells from sustained exposure to these interactions, we present a hydrogel-based biomimetic physical barrier (BPB) here to create a ""protective zone"" for T cells. The BPB temporarily blocks T cell-tumor cell interactions and shields T cells from inactivation and exhaustion, allowing them to accumulate and maintain their functional activity in the tumor microenvironment. After sufficient T cell accumulation, the dismantling of BPB triggered by near-infrared light irradiation-induced gel-sol transition will restore the interaction between T cells and tumor cells. This controlled re-exposure allows the accumulated T cells to attack the tumor cells in a more activated and anti-exhaustion state, maximizing their tumor-killing potential. Moreover, BPB not only enhances immediate tumor regression but also triggers systemic immune activation and durable memory responses, enabling long-term protection against tumor rechallenge and effective control of multifocal tumors. Collectively, our BPB for modulating the T cell-tumor cell interaction has great prospects for advancing cancer immunotherapy."
